# Open-Podcast

The Open-Podcast project was created by me due to a passion for podcasts, and a desire to create
a podcast app on Android that was free and not bloated with ads. Since I am a student the project
was unable to be worked on as much as I wanted around August-December. There are planned updates for
summer at the latest.

## Purpose

Additionally I wanted to learn more Android development and general programming skills. 
Such as MVP, data binding, media players, single-page app using fragments in a single activity, etc.

## What I learned

The largest thing I learned is the value of extensive planning. I had issues where I thought I knew
enough of a certain portion but found issues that popped up later, such as the media player being in
the MainActivity rather than the Application, requiring a frustrating workaround.

Everything I did plan extensively worked with few hiccups, and made work later on
significantly easier. This was also with help from Dagger 2 and MVP design. 

## Feautre Roadmap (In no particular order)

- Implement Exoplayer alternative
- Optional Crashlytics (from Firebase)
